    <h1>My Cats!</h1>
    <p>I have two cats named Jasper and Frankie! I got them from the human society 
      on Adopt a Black Cat day. They're brother and sister, but they have very different
      personalities.
    </p>
    <h2>Jasper</h2>
    <img src="img/Jasper.jpg" alt="A photo of my cat, Jasper.">
    <p>This is Jasper. He looks like a grumper, but he's really only grumpy
      about 30% of the time. He loves:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Being outside</li>
      <li>Screaming about not being able to go outside</li>
      <li>Being cuddly between the hours of 7-9AM and 9-11PM daily</li>
      <li>Aggressively grooming his sister</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Frankie</h2>

    <p>This is Frankie dressed as a bat for Halloween. I know, she's disgustingly cute.
      Frankie loves 3 things most of all:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Cuddling. All day every day all the time why aren't you 
        cuddling her right now?</li>
      <li>Eating. Or maybe what she actually loves is the anticipation while
        the can of food is being opened.</li>
      <li>Yelling at whoever is around for either not cuddling or not
        feeding her, depending on her inclination.</li>
    </ol>
